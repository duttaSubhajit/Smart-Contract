# Blockchain Developer Smart Contract

This repository contains a basic implementation of a smart contract written in Solidity, along with a simple frontend interface to interact with the contract.

## Smart Contract

The smart contract is implemented in Solidity and provides the following functionalities:

- Deposit funds: Users can deposit Ether into the contract.
- Withdraw funds: Users can withdraw their deposited Ether from the contract.
- Stake tokens: Users can stake their deposited tokens in the contract.
- Unstake tokens: Users can unstake their previously staked tokens.
- Calculate and distribute rewards: Users receive rewards for staking, with rewards increasing based on the length of time staked. The contract handles the calculation and distribution of rewards.

Please note that this is a basic implementation for educational purposes and may not include all necessary security measures or edge case handling required for production use.

## Frontend Interface

The frontend interface provides a user-friendly way to interact with the smart contract. It includes the following features:

- Display account information: Shows the user's account address, balance, staked balance, staked time, and reward balance.
- Actions buttons: Allows users to perform actions such as depositing, withdrawing, staking, unstaking, and claiming rewards.

## Prerequisites

To run the application, you need the following:

- An Ethereum provider (such as Metamask) installed in your browser.
- An internet connection.
- A compatible web browser.

## Running the Application

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Make sure your Ethereum provider (such as Metamask) is connected to the desired network.
4. You should see the frontend interface, displaying your account information.
5. Use the action buttons to interact with the smart contract (e.g., deposit, withdraw, stake, unstake, claim rewards).

## Customize the Smart Contract

If you want to customize the smart contract or deploy your own version, follow these steps:

1. Modify the smart contract code in `AssignmentContract.sol` according to your requirements.
2. Compile the Solidity code using a Solidity compiler (e.g., Remix, Truffle, etc.).
3. Deploy the compiled smart contract to your desired Ethereum network.
4. Update the `contractAddress` variable in the `index.html` file with your deployed contract's address.
